## PROJECT EXPERIENCE

**Concurrent Intersection Simulator** (C, Pthreads & Locks)  
- Synchronized 100+ concurrent vehicle threads across three routes and left-turn lanes  
  using eight custom mutex locks.  
- Enforced car-first priority via per-route counters; achieved zero deadlocks in 1,000+ tests.

**OS/161 Kernel Extensions** (C, Kernel Development)  
- Implemented six core syscalls (`getpid`, `getppid`, `fork`, `execv`, `waitpid`, `exit`).  
- Passed 95%+ of 120 automated tests; handled trapframe duplication and address-space copying.

**Task Manager** (C, UNIX)  
- Built a deterministic manager supporting create, suspend, resume, kill, pipe, and chain.  
- Blocked race conditions via signal masking; validated against 50+ scenarios with GDB & Valgrind.

**Interactive Choropleth Map & COVID-19 Analysis** (Python, Jupyter)  
- Processed 50K+ rows of global COVID-19 data, cleaned and merged with Pandas/GeoPandas.  
- Generated dynamic choropleth maps for 200+ countries using Matplotlib, Seaborn, Folium.

**Topological Sort Simulator** (Java)  
- Computed shortest paths in directed graphs up to 10K nodes using generics and priority queues.  
- Optimized performance to O(E log V), reducing execution time by 30%.
